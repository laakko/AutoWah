### Auto-Wah Audio Plugin

(final project for Audio Signal Processing-course)

A realtime Auto-Wah effect plugin implementation using C++ and JUCE framework.
The filter parameters are gotten from a popular Dunlop CryBaby wah pedal, and the cutoff frequency
is controlled by an envelope follower.

The provided .dll file is a 32 bit VST-plugin which can be used with most DAWs (Audacity, Reaper, etc.)
